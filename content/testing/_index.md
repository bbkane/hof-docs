__hof__ has several testings systems powered by CUE.
This enables far more reuse of
snippets, test cases, and commands.
Tests can also be selected by attribute
for targeted execution.
You also get all the power and flexibility of CUE
when defining tests and cases.

[Running tests](/testing/running/) with `hof test`
enables you to setup and run any tests
using Cue attributes and CLI flags.

The types of tests are:

- [External](/testing/external/) test systems can be invoked.
- [TSuite](/testing/tsuite/) for Cue based test cases.
- [API](/testing/api/) for testing REST and GraphQL servers.
- [HLS](/testing/hls/) for more complex, text file based setups.

The following sections will go into greater depth.
