This is what we are currently working on.
Expect rapid progress on this topic.

You will eventually find an introduction here.
In the meantime, check on progress via:

- [The Datamodel Notes](/notes/datamodel/) on this site.
- Keep an eye out for a new top-level section on this.
- [hof/schema/data*.cue](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof/tree/_dev/schema)
- [The chat rooms](https://gitter.im/hofstadter-io)

We'll add more links as they become available.
