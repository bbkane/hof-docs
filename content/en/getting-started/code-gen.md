Code generation is the core reason __hof__ was created.
It's how we turn single-source of truth designs into all the things.
It was needed so that when our datamodel changes,
we could edit just one or two design files
rather than dozens of source code, test files, and database schemas.

We are working on this concurrently with the datamodels work.
Like that section, we will post links here as they become available.
