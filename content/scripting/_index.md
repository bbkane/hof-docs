__hof__ has a scripting system called
Hofstadter Linear Script (HLS).
HLS is designed to combine

- the direct executability of Bash
- ability to work with data objects from Cue+__hof__
- test case orientedness from Golang's testsuite
- methods for working with multiple files in a single file from Golang's txtar

You can invoke these with `hof run` and there is a shell in the works.
